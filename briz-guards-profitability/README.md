# 🛡️ Briz Guards Profitability and Strategic Pricing Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the profit potential of Briz Guards, a Brisbane-based security company serving colleges, offices, and malls. The analysis evaluates:
- Acquisition vs. retention strategies
- Uniform vs. differentiated pricing
- Client profitability distribution
- Sector-specific contribution margins
- Scenario testing with Solver

All modeling is done using Excel with Solver optimizations, CLV analysis, and PLV computations.

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques
- Excel (Solver, TRUNC, IF, AVERAGE, NPV)
- Contribution Margin Analysis
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Profitability Lifetime Value (PLV)
- Sensitivity & Scenario Analysis
- Linear Demand Functions (per sector)

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 🔹 Current Profitability
- Net profit with current pricing: **$1.64M**
- Offices sector: highest contributor (**$1.52M**)

### 🔹 Uniform Pricing Strategy (Solver)
- New optimal fee: **$240,000**
- Net profit increases to **$2.23M**
- Still, Offices remains top performer

### 🔹 Differential Pricing Strategy (Solver)
- Optimal sector fees:  
  - Colleges: **$209,750**  
  - Offices: **$241,426**  
  - Malls: **$234,269**
- Highest possible profit: **$2.55M**

### 🔹 Sensitivity Analysis
- +20% price (uniform): **Loss of -$1.47M**
- +20% price (differential): **Reduced profit of $420K**

### 🔹 PLV Insights
- All sectors yield **negative PLV**
  - High acquisition cost ($100K) outweighs customer value
  - Retention > Acquisition recommended

## 📊 Contribution Margin Highlights

- **Colleges:** Top 60% are profitable, bottom 40% reduce net margin (10th decile = -26%)
- **Offices:** Most stable with strong CLV and margins across all deciles
- **Malls:** Highly volatile; top 60% ≈ +171% margin, but bottom 40% = -123% drag

## 💼 Business Recommendations

- ❌ Avoid acquisition under current cost/return conditions
- ✅ Shift to **sector-specific pricing** for maximum profit
- 🏢 **Offices** should receive strategic focus (highest ROI)
- ♻️ Emphasize **retention over acquisition** given negative PLVs
- 🛠 Improve bottom decile performance in **Colleges & Malls**
